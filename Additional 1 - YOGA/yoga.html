      Yoga is the process we can engage in to understand our body, the way it
      moves and the way we use it. We can engage with our mind and understand
      it, where it habitually goes and how to focus it. And we can work with our
      emotions and notice how we tend to react. Then we can build upon that and
      bring space so that we are not just responding to stimuli all of the time.
